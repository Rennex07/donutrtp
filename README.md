# DonutRTP

Highly configurable & optimized RTP plugin with automatic dimension detection (overworld, nether, end).
You can add more world as you want, use with deluxemenu if you want a gui.
Works with 1.21, spigot, paper, purpur, folia.

It sends messages to actionbar just like donutsmp.

commands: 
- /donutrtp reload
- /donutrtp <world>
I used /donutrtp so incase you want to use DeluxeMenu (open command rtp) it won't interfere with each other.
